# zkanji TEST v1
This is a temporary name. I will refer to the program simply as zkanji below.

## Description

zkanji is a cross-platform, feature rich Japanese language study suite and dictionary
software. It is still alpha, meaning it's not finished nor tested. It can damage its
own data files and files created by user interaction. zkanji has several kanji
look-up methods, example sentences for many Japanese words, vocabulary printing, JLPT
levels indicated for words and kanji, spaced-repetition system for studying and more.

Please see the License paragraph at the end of this readme about the license and
warranty information, and for credits of used libraries.

## Compiling from source

zkanji utilizes Qt 5, so an installation of Qt with its header files and libraries
must be present on the system. I used Qt version 5.5 during initial development, but
newer versions should work as well. zkanji can be compiled with c++ compilers that
are c++11 compatible and can use Qt.

On Windows, the minimal Visual Studio version capable of compiling zkanji is VS2013.
It is recommended, and possibly required, to use the Qt add-on for Visual Studio. GNU
c++ compilers should have no problem compiling zkanji either but I haven't tested it
yet. Currently only the Visual Studio project file is included. If it is set up
correctly, zkanji should compile out of the box. (You might need to modify the file
called zkanji.vcxproj.user, to change the path to Qt)

Instructions for other OSes will be added later as I figure them out.

## Setting up the data files

The following files must be downloaded, before the data files can be generated by
zkanji:  
[JMdict](http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html) in UTF-8 encoding  
[KANJIDIC](http://nihongo.monash.edu/kanjidic.html) in EUC-JP encoding  
[RADKFILE](http://users.monash.edu/~jwb/kradinf.html) also in EUC-JP encoding.

For the example sentences data, download the complete version of the
[Tanaka Corpus](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus) in UTF-8 encoding.
The downloadable subset of Tanaka Corpus is also usable, but it's only available in
EUC-JP encoding on the site, so it must be converted to UTF-8 first with the name
`examples.utf`.

The files must be extracted from their archives into a single folder, and the files
found in the `dataimports` folder must be copied there as well.

To generate the data files for zkanji, you need to create a folder called `data` next
to the executable, and run the compiled program with command line options listed
here.

The command line option for generating the dictionary data files is:  
`-i [path]`  
Path must point to the folder containing the extracted files.

To generate the example sentences data file, use the command line option:  
`-e [path]`  
The `examples.utf` file must be on the passed path.

The options can be combined. For example on Windows the following line will create
every necessary data file for zkanji after correcting the path:  
`zkanji.exe -ie C:\projects\zkanji\dataimports`

If the data files are generated successfully, zkanji will start. See the next section
too.

## Running for the first time

When run for the first time, zkanji might offer to run normally or in portable mode.
For this test version, it's recommended to start the program in portable mode, to
save the data files next to the executable in the `data` folder. (The user must have
read/write access to the files in the folder.) If normal mode is selected, the user
data files will be saved in a user folder appropriate for the system.

The program will offer to import user data from zkanji v0.731 next. If this step is
skipped, the old files can only be imported after deleting the generated user files.
(Files with the `.zkdict` and `.zkuser` extensions in the `data` folder.)

An earlier program called zkanji, released before 2014 used a different license,
which is not applicatble to this version.

The folder named `Qxt` contains unmodified source code from the Qxt project. It is

zkanji. See the `Qxt/AUTHORS` file for the authors who contributed to that project.

## Credits

Qt is used for the cross platform user interface. On Windows (which currently is the
only platform,) zkanji is linked dynamically with the Qt DLLs.

Some files from Qxt, a project to extend Qt, were linked to the program. They can be
found in the `Qxt` folder.
