# zkanji TEST v1
This is a temporary name. I will refer to the program simply as zkanji.

You can find the source code of the program on [GitHub](https://github.com/z1dev/zkanji).

## Description

zkanji is an open-source, cross-platform, feature rich Japanese language study suite
and dictionary software. It is still alpha, meaning it's not finished nor tested. Use
it at your own risk! zkanji has several kanji look-up methods, example sentences for
many Japanese words, vocabulary printing, JLPT levels indicated for words and kanji,
a spaced-repetition system for studying and more.

Please see the License and credit sections at the end of this readme.

## VERY short history of zkanji

The first version of zkanji was released in the late 2000s (or 00s.) The final version
was released in 2013, which can be downloaded from its project page on
[Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/zkanji/). I more or less lost interest
to develop the program further at the time.  

I wanted to revive zkanji, and started working on the next version in 2015. Since
v0.731 was made with a compiler and library I no longer use, I had to start over the
project from scratch. This is when I decided to make it cross-platform, and chose
Qt as the library for the user interface. I finally reached a point in 2017 to
release this new version, and plan to develop it further.

## Compiling from source

zkanji utilizes Qt 5, so an installation of the Qt SDK with its header files and
libraries must be present on the system. I used Qt version 5.5 during initial
development, but newer versions should work as well. zkanji can be compiled with C++
compilers that are C++11 compatible and can use Qt.

On Windows, the minimal Visual Studio version capable of compiling zkanji is VS2013.
It is recommended, and possibly required, to use the Qt add-on for Visual Studio. GNU
C++ compilers should have no problem compiling zkanji either but I haven't tested it
yet. Currently only the Visual Studio project file is included. If it is set up
correctly, zkanji should compile out of the box. (You might need to modify the file
called zkanji.vcxproj.user, to change the path to Qt)

Instructions for other OSes will be added later as I figure them out.

## Setting up the data files

The following files must be downloaded before the data files can be generated by
zkanji:  
[JMdict](http://www.edrdg.org/jmdict/j_jmdict.html) in UTF-8 encoding  
[kanjidic](http://nihongo.monash.edu/kanjidic.html) in EUC-JP encoding  
[radkfile](http://users.monash.edu/~jwb/kradinf.html) also in EUC-JP encoding.

For the example sentences data, download the complete version of the
[Tanaka Corpus](http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus) in UTF-8 encoding.
The downloadable subset of the Tanaka Corpus is also usable, but it's only available
in EUC-JP encoding on the site, so it must be converted to UTF-8 first with the name
`examples.utf`.

The files must be extracted from their archives into a single folder, and the files
found in the `dataimports` folder must be copied there as well.

To generate the data files for zkanji, you need to create a folder called `data` next
to the executable. Place `zdict.zks` from the data folder of zkanji v0.731 in it, and
run the compiled program with the appropriate command line options listed below.

The command line option for generating the dictionary data files is:  
`-i [path]`  
Path must point to the folder containing the extracted JMdict, KANJIDIC and RADKFILE.

To generate the example sentences data file, use the command line option:  
`-e [path]`  
The `examples.utf` file must be on the passed path.

The options can be combined. For example on Windows the following line will create
every necessary data file for zkanji after correcting the path:  
`zkanji.exe -ie C:\projects\zkanji\dataimports`

If the data files are generated successfully, zkanji will start. See the next section
too.

## Running for the first time

When run for the first time, zkanji might offer to run normally or in portable mode.
For this test version, it's recommended to start the program in portable mode, to
save the data files next to the executable in the `data` folder. (The user must have
read/write access to the files in the folder.) If normal mode is selected, the user
data files will be saved in a user folder appropriate for the system.

The program will offer to import user data from zkanji v0.731 next. If this step is
skipped, the old files can only be imported after deleting the generated user files.
(Files with the `.zkdict` and `.zkuser` extensions in the `data` folder.)

## Credits

Qt is used for the cross platform user interface. On Windows (which currently is the
only platform,) zkanji is linked dynamically with the Qt DLLs.

Some files from Qxt, a project to extend Qt, were linked to the program. They can be
found in the `Qxt` folder.

zkanji wouldn't be possible without JMdict (a free Japanese dictionary,) KANJIDIC
(holding information about 6355 kanji) and RADKFILE. They are the property of [The
Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group, Monash University](http://www.edrdg.org/).
